# Project1: Advanced tic-tac-toe

## Introduction 

I was tasked with creating a browser-based game at General Assembly, and I chose to build an advanced version of Tic-Tac-Toe. This game introduces a strategic twist to the classic version. Each move influences where the opponent can play next, encouraging both tactical thinking and forward planning. It's not just about winning one board—it's about managing multiple boards at once.
I really enjoyed developing it, and I hope you have just as much fun playing it!

And that is how the game looks like

## 🕹️ How to Play

- The game is a nested version of Tic-Tac-Toe. Each square in the outer 3×3 board contains another 3×3 inner board.
- The game starts with Player X, who can play in any inner square.
- The position where X plays dictates where O must play next (if X plays in the top-right square of an inner board, O must play in the top-right outer board).
- If an inner board ends in a win, the winning player's symbol appears in the outer square.
- If an inner board ends in a tie, the outer square remains empty.
- The first player to win three outer squares in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins the game!
